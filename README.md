# Bike Purchases Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike purchase data using Excel. The dataset contains details about customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and lifestyle factors. The primary objectives of this project were to clean the raw data, analyze customer patterns, and create visual dashboards for meaningful insights.

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes information about customers and whether they purchased a bike or not. Key columns include:
- **Region**: Customer's geographical location.
- **Commute Distance**: Distance the customer commutes regularly.
- **Education**: Highest level of education attained by the customer.
- **Income**: Customer's annual income.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **No. of Cars**: Number of cars owned by the customer.
- **No. of Children**: Number of children in the customer's household.
- **Occupation**: Customer's job role or title.
- **Purchased Bike**: Indicates whether the customer purchased a bike (`Yes` or `No`).

## Steps Taken
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary spaces and duplicates.
- Corrected inconsistent entries (e.g., case formatting, missing values).
- Standardized the dataset for analysis (e.g., numeric conversions, categorical mapping).

### 2. Data Analysis
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Examined key customer attributes, such as income levels, commute distances, and car ownership, to identify trends.
- **Segmentation**: Divided the data into two main themes for analysis:
  1. **Entire Customer Base**: Includes all customers (those who purchased and those who did not).
  2. **Bike Buyers Only**: Focuses solely on customers who successfully purchased a bike.

### 3. Pivot Tables
Created pivot tables to:
- Summarize data by region, income, and gender.
- Compare purchasing behavior by commute distance, education level, and occupation.
- Analyze bike purchasing trends based on family size and car ownership.

### 4. Dashboards
Designed two interactive dashboards:
- **Dashboard 1: Overall Customer Analysis**  
  Highlights trends across the entire customer base, showing key insights into demographics, income, and lifestyle.
  
- **Dashboard 2: Bike Buyers Analysis**  
  Focuses on customers who purchased a bike, identifying attributes and behaviors that correlate with successful purchases.

## Key Insights
- Customers with higher incomes and fewer cars are more likely to purchase bikes.
- Regions with shorter average commute distances show a higher bike purchase rate.
- Educational background and occupation play significant roles in determining purchase likelihood.
- Families with more children are less likely to buy bikes, possibly due to other expenses.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dashboard design.
- **Pivot Tables**: For summarizing data and identifying trends.
- **Dashboards**: To visualize insights and present the analysis in an engaging manner.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Excel in analyzing and presenting customer data effectively. The analysis provides actionable insights into customer behavior, which can help businesses tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and increase bike sales.
